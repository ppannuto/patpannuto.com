Who Am I?

My name is Pat Pannuto, and I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Michigan.

I am advised by [Prabal Dutta](http://eecs.umich.edu/~prabal). I am the
recipient of the [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship](https://ndseg.asee.org/) (2013),
the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) Fellowship](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2013),
and the [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (QInF)](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship) (2013).
I am currently supported by NDSEG.

My research focuses on solving the "last inch" problem: bringing connectivity
and computing capability to everything. A key component of this is the
[cubic millimeter](http://cubicmm.eecs.umich.edu) project, which aims to bring
general-purpose computing and sensing to millimeter-scale devices. Recently, we
identified the system interconnect as a key impediment to further scaling the
energy and area of embedded computing. To address this, I led the design of
[MBus, a new chip-to-chip interconnect](http://mbus.io) optimized for
energy-conscious designs.

In addition, I've worked on solving the indoor localization problem, both using
[visible light and smartphones][luxapose] and a [novel RF-based
approach][harmonia] that achieves ultra-wideband accuracy (order 1-10 cm) using
only narrowband components. I've also done some work on exploring [alternative
sensing schemes for monitoring power grid health][gridwatch] and [tracking
human interactions with high spatio-temporal fidelity][opo].
