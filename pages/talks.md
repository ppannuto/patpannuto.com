### The Recent Past and Distant Future of [Micro-Scale] Embedded Systems, Keynote at [NextMote: Next Generation Platforms for the Cyber-Physical Internet][nextmote16]
NextMote was a new workshop at [EWSN'16][ewsn16]. Inspired by the work we have
been doing in [millimeter-scale system design][mbus], I was invited to come
I was invited to come give the keynote presentation to open the new workshop.

The talk traverses the evolution from yesterday's motes to "next" and
"next-next" generation motes. Along the way we'll face a few harsh realities
that will limit and shape future evolution (a trillion devices cannot demand
replacing a trillion batteries), uncover recent results already pushing
boundaries (including highlights from the design and implementation of the
world's smallest computer), and explore some of the possibilities that emerge
when we rethink designs from the ground up (can we build useful motes that
don't include CPUs?).

### MBus: An Ultra-Low Power Interconnect for Next Generation Nanopower Systems, [42nd International Symposium on Computer Architecture][isca15]
This presentation introduces [MBus][mbus], the missing interconnect technology
that enables the millimeter-scale computing class. From the
[Michigan Micro Mote (M<sup>3</sup>)](http://cubicmm.eecs.umich.edu) project, an
effort develop next-next generation millimeter-scale computers today, we
discovered that the traditional technologies for composing embedded systems,
I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI, cannot scale to millimeter-scale designs. We drafted a
set of fundamental requirements for a millimeter-scale interconnect, and show
that no existing interconnect satisfies these requirements. We then take these
requirements and design a new interconnect, MBus, optimizing for
millimeter-scale systems while providing a superset of features from existing
interconnect technologies. For more information on MBus and the M<sup>3</sup>
project, visit [mbus.io][mbus].

### Lessons from Five Years of Making Michigan Micro Motes (M<sup>3</sup>), [6th Workshop on Architectural Research Prototyping][warp15]
[WARP'15][warp15] hearkened the return of a workshop that had been on a
five-year hiatus. The workshop seeks to both motivate the importance and value
of actually building systems in the architecture community as well as to share
lessons and experiences from fabrication. This talk begins by highlighting an
architectural problem, the absence of an interconnect technology that is
appropriate for mm-scale modules, and our solution to that issue: [MBus][mbus].
The talk then covers a breadth of the system, manufacturing, and design issues
that we have solved and are struggling with for the Michigan Micro Mote project.
Finally, the talk closes with an introduction of an emerging issue in low-power
system design, the need for an indirection layer for peripheral control and
semi-automated operations, and our solution to that issue, the MPQ protocol
for MBus.

[TC111][tc111] was a online course focusing on skills and strategies for
collecting, managing, analyzing, and visualizing Information Communication
Technologies put on by [TechChange][techchange]. I was asked to give a guest
lecture on the capabilities and added value of sensor deployments as well as
the challenges in recovering data from deployments, with a focus on how
non-technical organizations can realize and utilize sensing. This presentation

[VLCS'14][vlcs14] was a new workshop attached to [MobiCom'14][mobicom14]. This
talk presented our initial research into the design of Software-Defined
Lighting (SDL), in particular looking at the diversity of applications already
created and coming down the pipe and looking at ways of mapping all of these
applications to a single, unified lighting network. A copy of the workshop
[paper](/publications.html#kuo14vlc_arch) is also
available.

The workshop was a kickoff for the Stanford Internet of Things Industrial
Research Program. I was asked to describe the state of security for the
Internet of Things, in particular looking from the perspective of an embedded
systems hardware and network developer. The talk gives an overview of some
recent research, some challenges and directions in networking, and a
discussion of the hardware trends, expectations, and requirements for embedded
systems, all with an eye towards security.

I was asked to give a presentation on the state of sensors and sensor networks
as they are available today with an emphasis on the challenges of actually
deploying systems. I was also asked to touch on the current state of research in
the area and what kinds of interesting systems are coming down the pipe.

### Introduction to Git, [Michigan Hackers](http://michiganhackers.org/)

The Michigan Hackers are a student group at the University of Michigan who
attempt to bring together people interested in building system.
For the last few years, they've thrown [the largest
hackathon](http://mhacks.org/) in the world. In their nascency, I was invited to
give one of the first tech talks. The audience was primarily experienced
hackers, so the goal of the talk was to dive into the internals of
[git](http://git-scm.com/). I presented a slide deck put together by Scott
Chacon, [available here](https://github.com/schacon/git-presentations).

### Exploring Powerline Networking for the Smart Building, [IP+SN 2011](http://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/ip+sn2011/)

[IP+SN 2011](http://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/ip+sn2011/) was a workshop attached to
the [IPSN 2011](http://ipsn.acm.org/2011/) conference in downtown Chicago. I
attended this workshop as an undergraduate, presenting some of the first
research I ever worked on. The impetus for the work was trying to reconcile
the cognitive dissonance of using wireless as the medium to connect AC power
meters, devices that are literally wired together already. The result was that
powerline networking is not as trivial as I'd hoped, with a fairly
non-intuitive connectivity graph. The takeaway was that hybrid routing,
leveraging the physically long hops provided by powerline communication and
using wireless to bridge disjoint powerline networks, would likely provide the
most efficient building-wide network.
