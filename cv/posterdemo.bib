	abstract={For the last fifteen years, research explored the hardware,
		software, sensing, communication abstractions, languages, and
			protocols that could make networks of small, embedded
			devices---motes---sample and report data for long
			periods of time unattended.
			Today, the application and technological landscapes
			have shifted, introducing new requirements and new
			capabilities. Hardware has evolved past 8~and 16~bit
			microcontrollers: there are now 32~bit processors with
			lower energy budgets and greater computing capability.
			New wireless link layers have emerged, creating
			protocols that support rapid and efficient setup and
			teardown but introduce novel limitations that systems
			must consider.
			The time has come to look beyond optimizing networks of
			motes. We look towards new technologies such as
			Bluetooth Low Energy, Cortex~M processors, and capable
			energy harvesting, with new application spaces such as
			personal area networks, and new capabilities and
			requirements in security and privacy to inform
			contemporary hardware and software platforms.  It is
			time for a new, open experimental platform in this
			post-mote era.

	abstract = { We propose Get All The Data (GATD), a data collection and dissemination
			system for the Swarm. GATD offers a flexible architecture to connect arbitrary
			producers of data and consumers of events. Too many sensor networks are
			fragile, vertical silos, with a series of one-off handlers written to shuttle
			data, manipulate it, process it, and present it. Instead of being mired
			in details and rigid schemas, we argue that sensor network deployment should
			be simple. The key in GATD's design is the
			observation that there are common patterns to how disparate sensor network
			applications handle and process their generated data.

			To take advantage of these
			similarities we present a system comprised of common modules that
			different applications can leverage.
			To join GATD, new sensors simply send raw data. GATD will buffer this raw
			data indefinitely until an application specific {\em formatter} is written to
			map the raw data to key-value pairs. These streams can be combined, processed,
			graphed, stored, or otherwise manipulated by a standard set of transforms or
			new custom drivers. With this architecture, we argue that GATD provides a
			robust, extensible, and versatile Swarm dataplane.

			non-trivial.

			We present a functional 0.4mm~x~0.8mm ARM Cortex~M0 with 3KB of RAM, 24~GPIOs,
			and an ultra-low power I2C interface. This chip is part of the Michigan Micro
			Mote (M3) project, which is designed to build a complete software and hardware
			platform for general purpose sensing at the millimeter scale. We demo an I2C
			interface circuit allowing commercial hardware to program and interact with the
			chip and present the beginning of the millimeter scale sensing revolution.
