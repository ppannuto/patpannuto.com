  abstract={This demo showcases the power delivery potential of soil-based
microbial fuel cells. We build a prototype energy harvesting setup
for a soil microbial fuel cell, measure the amount of power that we
can harvest, and use that energy to drive an e-ink display. Microbial
fuel cells are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, especially
soil moisture. In near-optimal, super moist conditions our
cell provides approximately 100\,\uW of power at around 500\,mV,
which is ample power over time to power our system several times
a day. In sum, we find that the confluence of ever lower-power
electronics and new understanding of microbial fuel cell design
means that ``soil-powered sensors'' are now feasible. There remains,
however, significant future work to make these systems reliable
and maximally performant.
This demo is a working copy of the system presented at LP-IoT'21.

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling deeper insight into how our
urban environments function. Applications such as observing air quality and
measuring traffic flows can have powerful impacts, allowing city
planners and citizen scientists alike to understand and improve their world.
However, the path from conceiving applications to implementing them is fraught with difficulty.
A successful city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power
management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good
idea and a realized one.

The Signpost platform, presented at IPSN 2018, has been created 
to address these challenges. Signpost
enables easy deployment by relying on harvested, solar energy and wireless
networking rather than their wired counterparts. To further lower the bar
to deploying applications, the platform provides the key resources necessary
to support its pluggable sensor modules in their distributed sensing tasks. 
In this demo, we present the Signpost hardware and
several applications running on a deployment of Signposts on UC Berkeley's campus,
including distributed, energy-adaptive traffic monitoring and 
fine grained weather reporting. Additionally we show the cloud infrastructure
supporting the Signpost deployment, specifically the ability to push new
applications and parameters down to existing sensors, with the goal of demonstrating that 
the existing deployment can serve as a future testbed.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we
show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve
a 53\% decrease in median range error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
In stationary and fast-moving environments SurePoint achieves up to
0.08\,m median error and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we
employ a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon, however SurePoint is the first to demonstrate constructive interface
using the 802.15.4a ultra-wideband PHY.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we utilize TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

This demo complements the paper ``SurePoint: Exploiting Ultra Wideband Flooding
and Diversity to Provide Robust, Scalable, High-Fidelity Indoor Localization''
to be presented at SenSys'16.

		  of diversity: frequency diversity, which leverages several ultra-wideband

We present a set of these pieces, including a gateway, four hardware building
blocks, multiple sensor platforms, an indoor localization system, and software
for connecting users and devices.
Each piece plays an integral role towards
enabling applications, from facilitating rapid development of wireless smart
devices to composing data streams and services from a diverse set of components.
By providing layered interoperable systems, our toolkit offers cohesive
support for moving beyond single-device, cloud-centric applications---typical
in today's IoT landscape---and towards richer applications that incorporate
multiple data streams, human interaction, cloud processing, location awareness,
multiple communication protocols, historical data, access control, and
on-demand user interfaces.
To show how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based
access control application where a user's smartphone can control a room's lighting,
but only from within the room. Further, data streams from the phone and
nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts
to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

is a constrained version of indoor localization, with minimal time
constraints and static devices. However, as we intend to include the
DW1000 hardware on our own localization system, this provides
an opportunity for gathering performance data for a commercially-enabled
localization system deployed by a third-party for comparison purposes.

to locations, and the front-end for viewing the results.},

    Luxapose addresses the indoor localization problem
with unmodified smartphones and software controlled LED luminaires.
Each luminaire, while providing normal lighting for a space,
transmits an identifier by switching the luminaire on-and-off at a particular
frequency. The pulses are imperceptible to humans, but smartphone
cameras can detect the switching by exploiting the rolling shutter effect
of CMOS cameras. Once the camera captures an image, the image
is processed to find the luminaires, determine their identifiers,
construct a sufficiently constrained angle-of-arrival localization
problem, and ultimately calculate the smartphone's position and
orientation in space.

Luxapose requires LED lighting infrastructure for localization, however,
the LED lights can replace the current lighting in a building. Luxapose
has virtually no cost to the end-users, requiring just an app on the
smartphone they already carry. The system has demonstrated ninetieth percentile
position error of 10~cm and orientation error of 10~degrees when the
smartphone is held under the LED luminaires.
