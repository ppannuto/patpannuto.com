Current methodologies for detecting heavy elements rely on labor-intensive sampling methods and time-consuming laboratory analysis, limiting temporal and spatial resolution. We present HERMES, an in-development heavy metal monitoring system that can be placed around high risk areas. HERMES leverages soil microbial fuel cells as autonomous biosensors. These biosensors when deployed as a sensor field, can monitor soil conditions and transmit data using a distributed machine learning framework. By providing improvements in the speed and resolution of heavy metal contamination detection, HERMES aims to enable earlier intervention and mitigate long-term damages.},

    We demonstrate how to leverage Apple's Find My protocol, most
well known as the underlying protocol of the AirTag, for arbitrary
data-muling. This provides a new ``infrastructure-free'' deployment
option, where areas with frequent human activity can take advantage of this zero-cost backhaul network. While there are severe
limitations (e.g. no acknowledgement channel back to the sending
device), Find My-based networking could still be a highly reliable
backhaul with sufficient transmission redundancy and knowledge
of deployment context.

In this demo, we allow users to send arbitrary data to devices
that will forward the data to the Find My network. The data is
then recovered from Apple's servers and displayed on a status
page. Critically, we will not deploy any of our own intermediate
infrastructure and will instead rely on a sufficient density of iPhones
and other Apple devices from the demo audience to backhaul data
from our demo.

fuel cells are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, especially
soil moisture. In near-optimal, super moist conditions our
cell provides approximately 100\,\uW of power at around 500\,mV,
which is ample power over time to power our system several times
a day. In sum, we find that the confluence of ever lower-power

means that ``soil-powered sensors'' are now feasible. There remains,
however, significant future work to make these systems reliable

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling deeper insight into how our
urban environments function. Applications such as observing air quality and
measuring traffic flows can have powerful impacts, allowing city
planners and citizen scientists alike to understand and improve their world.
However, the path from conceiving applications to implementing them is fraught with difficulty.
A successful city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power
management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good
idea and a realized one.

The Signpost platform, presented at IPSN 2018, has been created 
to address these challenges. Signpost
enables easy deployment by relying on harvested, solar energy and wireless
networking rather than their wired counterparts. To further lower the bar
to deploying applications, the platform provides the key resources necessary
to support its pluggable sensor modules in their distributed sensing tasks. 
In this demo, we present the Signpost hardware and
several applications running on a deployment of Signposts on UC Berkeley's campus,
including distributed, energy-adaptive traffic monitoring and 
fine grained weather reporting. Additionally we show the cloud infrastructure
supporting the Signpost deployment, specifically the ability to push new
applications and parameters down to existing sensors, with the goal of demonstrating that 
the existing deployment can serve as a future testbed.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we
show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve
a 53\% decrease in median range error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
In stationary and fast-moving environments SurePoint achieves up to
0.08\,m median error and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we
employ a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon, however SurePoint is the first to demonstrate constructive interface
using the 802.15.4a ultra-wideband PHY.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we utilize TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

This demo complements the paper ``SurePoint: Exploiting Ultra Wideband Flooding
and Diversity to Provide Robust, Scalable, High-Fidelity Indoor Localization''
to be presented at SenSys'16.

To show how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based
access control application where a user's smartphone can control a room's lighting,
but only from within the room. Further, data streams from the phone and
nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts
to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

    Luxapose addresses the indoor localization problem
with unmodified smartphones and software controlled LED luminaires.
Each luminaire, while providing normal lighting for a space,
transmits an identifier by switching the luminaire on-and-off at a particular
frequency. The pulses are imperceptible to humans, but smartphone
cameras can detect the switching by exploiting the rolling shutter effect
of CMOS cameras. Once the camera captures an image, the image
is processed to find the luminaires, determine their identifiers,
construct a sufficiently constrained angle-of-arrival localization
problem, and ultimately calculate the smartphone's position and
orientation in space.

Luxapose requires LED lighting infrastructure for localization, however,
the LED lights can replace the current lighting in a building. Luxapose
has virtually no cost to the end-users, requiring just an app on the
smartphone they already carry. The system has demonstrated ninetieth percentile
position error of 10~cm and orientation error of 10~degrees when the
smartphone is held under the LED luminaires.
