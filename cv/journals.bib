	abstract = {This paper presents a fully synthesizable low power
	    interconnect bus for millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. A
	    segmented ring bus topology minimizes the required chip real estate
	    with low input/output pad count for ultra-small form factors.  By
	    avoiding the conventional open drain-based solution, the bus can be
	    fully synthesizable. Low power is achieved by obviating a need for
	    local oscillators in member nodes. Also, aggressive power gating
	    allows low-power standby mode with only 53 gates powered on. An
	    integrated wakeup scheme is compatible with a power management unit
	    that has nW standby mode. A 3-module system including the bus is
	    fabricated in a 180\,nm process. The entire system consumes 8\,nW in
	    standby mode, and the bus achieves 17.5\,pJ/bit/chip.

		``shoot-through'' rings that resolves fundamental size and
			power issues that prevent the design of composable
			microscale systems. MBus introduces power-oblivious
			communication, which guarantees message reception
			regardless of the recipient's power state. This

	abstract = {We introduce {\em Harmonia}, a new RF-based localization scheme
		  that provides the simplicity, cost, and power advantages of
		  traditional narrowband radios with the decimeter-scale
		  accuracy of ultra wideband localization techniques. Harmonia is
		  an asymmetric {\em tag} and {\em anchor} system, requiring
		  minimal modifications to existing low-power wireless devices
		  to support high-fidelity localization with comparatively
		  modest infrastructure costs.  A prototype Harmonia design offers
		  location estimates with an average-case error of 53.4~cm in
		  complex, heavy-multipath, indoor environments and captures
		  location estimates at 56~Hz while requiring only 1.7~mA
		  additional power draw for each tag and complying with all
		  US~UWB regulations.  We believe this architecture's
		  combination of accuracy, update rate, power draw, and system
		  complexity will lead to a new point in the design space.

	abstract = {A 1.0~mm general-purpose sensor node platform with heterogeneous multi-layer structure is proposed.  The sensor platform benefits from modularity by allowing the addition/removal of IC layers. A new low power I$^2$C interface is introduced for energy efficient inter-layer communication with compatibility to commercial I$^2$C protocols. A self-adapting power management unit is proposed for efficient battery voltage down conversion for wide range of battery voltages and load current. The power management unit also adapts itself by monitoring energy harvesting conditions and harvesting sources and is capable of harvesting from solar, thermal and microbial fuel cells. An optical wakeup receiver is proposed for sensor node programming and synchronization with 228~pW standby power. The system also includes two processors, timer, temperature sensor, and low-power imager. Standby power of the system is 11~nW.},
