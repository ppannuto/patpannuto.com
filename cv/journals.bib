abstract = {The past few years has seen a massive success story for systems programming. Entire categories of bugs that used to plague systems programmers—like use-after-free, data races, and segmentation faults—have begun to completely disappear. The secret to this new reality is a set of systems programming languages chief among them Rust—whose powerful type systems are able to constructively eliminate these kind of bugs; if it compiles, then it's correct \dots{} or at least, will not contain use-after-free or other memory safety errors. These languages are gaining widespread adoption across industry and academia alike, and are adopted for ambitious and critical systems, such as new high-performance compute libraries, distributed storage systems, and operating systems.

Despite these successes, the reality is a little more complicated. There is a great amount of software already written in other languages. And often, external constraints such as certification requirements or developer expertise force even new components to be written in other, less safe languages. Therefore, an important feature for any new systems programming language is its ability to easily and efficiently interact with existing foreign libraries. Developers building new systems can leverage existing native cryptography, mathematics, graphical, and other libraries immediately, without waiting for them to first be ported to new languages and without suffering a performance hit. They can incrementally migrate existing systems, replacing components in a legacy C/C++ codebase with safe alternatives.

Unfortunately, interacting with foreign code can result in subtle, but nonetheless devastating safety violations that re-introduce the very concerns many developers are trying to avoid by using type-safe languages. For example, foreign libraries may themselves include memory safety vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSL’s infamous Heartbleed bug. When foreign code is invoked through a Foreign Function Interface (FFI), it runs in the same address space and with the same privileges as the host language. Therefore, vulnerabilities in native libraries can affect the entire host program and break memory or type safety guarantees.

While we are quick to reach for tools like process isolation, a system call boundary, or a client-server model to solve this, these tools often only help uphold memory safety, which is only half the battle. Each language has specific invariants over its types (like permissible values) which its compiler relies on when producing code. Ensuring that all types are correctly inhabited goes beyond memory safety; it requires type safety. In fact, memory and type safety are intertwined: a violation of one can easily break the other. And finally, some program invariants—like whether references can be aliased—require reasoning about both type and memory safety. Interactions with untrusted code or between different languages that violate these invariants can lead to undefined behavior and, in turn, break other safety properties.

We present Omniglot, a new approach and framework we have developed that can maintain both memory and type safety across interactions with untrusted foreign libraries, in different settings: we implement prototypes for Linux userspace applications and a Rust-based kernel. In this article, we want to focus on illustrating the fundamental link between memory and type safety through an example of interacting with a foreign library and provide an intuition on how the Omniglot framework works.

Soil Microbial Fuel Cells (SMFCs) offer promise as a renewable energy source that is biocompatible and viable in difficult environments where traditional batteries and solar panels fall short. However, SMFC development is in its infancy, and challenges like robustness to environmental factors and low power output stymie efforts to implement real-world applications in terrestrial environments. This work details a 2-year iterative process that uncovers barriers to practical SMFC design for powering electronics, which we address through a mechanistic understanding of SMFC theory from the literature. We present nine months of deployment data gathered from four SMFC experiments exploring cell geometries, resulting in an improved SMFC that generates power across a wider soil moisture range. From these experiments, we extracted key lessons and a testing framework, assessed SMFC's field performance, contextualized improvements with emerging and existing computing systems, and demonstrated the improved SMFC powering a wireless sensor for soil moisture and touch sensing. We contribute our data, methodology, and designs to establish the foundation for a sustainable, soil-powered future.},

We know well that harvesting RF, solar, or kinetic energy enables the creation of battery-free devices that can be used where frequent battery changes or dedicated power lines are impractical. One unusual yet ubiquitous source of power is soil (earth itself) - or more accurately, bacterial communities in soil. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are electrochemical cells that harness the activities of microbes that naturally occur in soil, wetlands, and wastewater. MFCs have been a topic of research in environmental engineering and microbiology for decades, but are a relatively new topic in electronics design and research. Most low-power electronics have traditionally opted for batteries, RF energy, or solar cells. This is changing, however, as the limitations and costs of these energy sources hamper our ability to deploy useful systems that last for decades in challenging environments. If large-scale, long-term applications like underground infrastructure monitoring, smart farming, and sensing for conservation are to be possible, we must rethink the energy source.},

  abstract={The interactions most supportive of positive child development take place in moments of close contact with others. In the earliest years of life, a child's caregivers are the primary partners in these important interactions. Little is known about the patterns of real-life physical interactions between children and their caregivers, in part due to an inability to measure these interactions as they occur in real time. We have developed a wearable, infrastructure-free device (TotTag) used to dynamically and unobtrusively measure physical proximity between children and caregivers in real time. We present a case-study illustration of the TotTag with data collected over two (12-hour) days each from two families: a family of four (30-month-old son, 61-month-old daughter, 37-year-old father, 37-year-old mother), and a family of three (12-month-old daughter, 35-year-old-father, 33-year-old mother). We explored patterns of proximity within each parent–child dyad and whether close proximity would indicate periods in which increased opportunity for developmentally critical interactions occur. Each child also wore a widely used wearable audio recording device (LENA) to collect time-synced linguistic input. Descriptive analyses reveal wide variability in caregiver–child proximity both within and across dyads, and that the amount of time spent in close proximity with a caregiver is associated with the number of adult words and conversational turns to which a child was exposed. This suggests that variations in proximity are linked to—though, critically, not synonymous with—the quantity of a child’s exposure to adult language. Potential implications for deepening the understanding of early caregiver–child interactions are discussed.},

     Recent work shows the exciting potential for soil microbes as a renewable energy harvesting source. However, the choice of materials in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) significantly impacts where the energy comes from. MFCs with metallic anodes draw energy from both renewable bacterial activity and nonrenewable galvanic corrosion of cell components. Previous studies do not analyze these two power sources separately. This letter clarifies the behavior of metallic MFCs by characterizing galvanic activity separately from biological activity. We find that the majority of energy attained from prior designs is most likely galvanic, not bacterial, and as a consequence is nonrenewable.

    The smartphone is an incredible computing platform. Loaded with powerful processing, vast data storage, near-global connectivity, built-in batteries, and a rich array of sensors, these devices reliably service the needs of billions of users every day. However, when tasked to run just a single application continuously without any human interaction, the smartphone platform becomes surprisingly unreliable. Over the course of a four-month deployment of Android-phone-based cellular gateways in Zanzibar, Tanzania, all 16 deployed phones failed despite significant engineering efforts, and six phones became physically damaged. This article examines what went wrong and how mobile computing platforms could adapt to support more traditional embedded computing roles and workloads.

   We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
   that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
   Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
   provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
   Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
   lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
   infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
   that calculates the tag's position.
   Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
   rejects narrowband interferers and
   extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
   traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
   In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
   Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average of 9\,cm of inter-sample
   noise.
   In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is
   less than 42\,cm.
   The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
   at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
   volumes.
   Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power
   realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium
   concepts in future integrated systems.
   Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
   and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
   devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
   systems.
