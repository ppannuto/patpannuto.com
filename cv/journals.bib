  abstract={The interactions most supportive of positive child development take place in moments of close contact with others. In the earliest years of life, a child's caregivers are the primary partners in these important interactions. Little is known about the patterns of real-life physical interactions between children and their caregivers, in part due to an inability to measure these interactions as they occur in real time. We have developed a wearable, infrastructure-free device (TotTag) used to dynamically and unobtrusively measure physical proximity between children and caregivers in real time. We present a case-study illustration of the TotTag with data collected over two (12-hour) days each from two families: a family of four (30-month-old son, 61-month-old daughter, 37-year-old father, 37-year-old mother), and a family of three (12-month-old daughter, 35-year-old-father, 33-year-old mother). We explored patterns of proximity within each parent–child dyad and whether close proximity would indicate periods in which increased opportunity for developmentally critical interactions occur. Each child also wore a widely used wearable audio recording device (LENA) to collect time-synced linguistic input. Descriptive analyses reveal wide variability in caregiver–child proximity both within and across dyads, and that the amount of time spent in close proximity with a caregiver is associated with the number of adult words and conversational turns to which a child was exposed. This suggests that variations in proximity are linked to—though, critically, not synonymous with—the quantity of a child’s exposure to adult language. Potential implications for deepening the understanding of early caregiver–child interactions are discussed.},

     Recent work shows the exciting potential for soil microbes as a renewable energy harvesting source. However, the choice of materials in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) significantly impacts where the energy comes from. MFCs with metallic anodes draw energy from both renewable bacterial activity and nonrenewable galvanic corrosion of cell components. Previous studies do not analyze these two power sources separately. This letter clarifies the behavior of metallic MFCs by characterizing galvanic activity separately from biological activity. We find that the majority of energy attained from prior designs is most likely galvanic, not bacterial, and as a consequence is nonrenewable.

    The smartphone is an incredible computing platform. Loaded with powerful processing, vast data storage, near-global connectivity, built-in batteries, and a rich array of sensors, these devices reliably service the needs of billions of users every day. However, when tasked to run just a single application continuously without any human interaction, the smartphone platform becomes surprisingly unreliable. Over the course of a four-month deployment of Android-phone-based cellular gateways in Zanzibar, Tanzania, all 16 deployed phones failed despite significant engineering efforts, and six phones became physically damaged. This article examines what went wrong and how mobile computing platforms could adapt to support more traditional embedded computing roles and workloads.

   We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
   that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
   Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
   provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
   Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
   lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
   infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
   that calculates the tag's position.
   Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
   rejects narrowband interferers and
   extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
   traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
   In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
   Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average of 9\,cm of inter-sample
   noise.
   In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is
   less than 42\,cm.
   The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
   at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
   volumes.
   Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power
   realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium
   concepts in future integrated systems.
   Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
   and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
   devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
   systems.

A self-adapting power management unit is proposed for efficient battery voltage down conversion for wide range of battery voltages and load current.

An optical wakeup receiver is proposed for sensor node programming and synchronization with 228~pW standby power. The system also includes two processors, timer, temperature sensor, and low-power imager. Standby power of the system is 11~nW.},
