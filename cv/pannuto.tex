\section*{Research Interests and Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[]
    From mainframes to wearables Bell's law captures the march of progress,
    noting the emergence of a new computing class roughly every decade.  My
    research explores what will be required to keep enabling these next
    generations of computing, how insights from the emerging centimeter-scale
    and nascent millimeter-scale computing class can solve problems across all
    domains, and how our expectations and interactions with technology will
    shift as we begin to realize the ubiquitous computing vision.

  \item[]
    The \textbf{MBus} project considers this from an architectural
    perspective, finding fundamental area and energy constraints in current
    interconnect technologies and demonstrating that shifting system
    management into the interconnect can simplify both system and circuit
    design.

    \textbf{Slocalization}, the first FCC-compliant ultra wideband backscatter
    platform, is motivated by deployment challenges, giving one answer for how
    we might manage the deployment of millions of miniature sensors.  It
    demonstrates decimeter-accurate sub-microwatt whole-room concurrent
    localization, creates a novel integration technique to recover signals
    from far below the noise floor, and introduces the energy versus latency
    tradeoff for systems design.

    \textbf{Harmonium} explores how to efficiently design an active ultra
    wideband tag, empowering opportunistic high-fidelity tracking, and first
    introduced the bandstitching technique that allows access to the ultra
    wideband channel using widely-available narrowband frontends.

    \textbf{SurePoint} investigates diversity in the ultra wideband channel,
    efficient protocols to capture multiple independent samples, and is the
    first to demonstrate constructive interference with 802.15.4a.

    The \textbf{Tock} operating system answers questions of management,
    bringing proper process isolation to embedded systems via new hardware and
    language features that afford safety. Tock addresses fundamental
    robustness and adaptability tensions with the introduction of grants, a
    mechanism for a statically allocated kernel to safely perform dynamic
    allocations in process memory.

    \textbf{Luxapose} shows how the smartphone camera can recover data from
    visible lights using the rolling shutter effect and realize
    centimeter-accurate position and single-degree accurate orientation from
    the projection of these lights on the camera imager.

    \textbf{Opo} crafts a novel, highly efficient ultrasonic wakeup
    frontend that enables a new broadcast ranging primitive, affording
    infrastructure-free human interaction tracking with high spatio-temporal
    fidelity.

    %aiming to understand how our interaction and utilization of technology
    %will shift as computing becomes omnipresent and its operation and
    %interaction shifts from conscious action to unconscious extension of
    %perception and ability.
    %What advancements will most change how people interact with themselves,
    %the world, and one another, and what innovations facilitate these paradigm
    %shifts?

\begin{itemize}

  \item[] Primary Instructor, EECS\,398: Computing for Computer Scientists (F16, W16)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] A new class designed and built from scratch. This class attempts
        to address the experience gap that exists across the spectrum of
        incoming Computer Science students. While driven by tools (shells,
        build systems, debuggers, version control), it explores how and why
        computer scientists interface with computers differently in their
        day-to-day activities, how to apply principles learned in courses to
        everyday activities, and ultimately how to be a more efficient user of
        computing resources.
      \item[] This course has been adopted as part of the permanent curriculum
        at the University of Michigan as EECS\,201: Computing Pragmatics, an
        advised co-requisite for first-year EECS majors.
