A new class designed and built from scratch.
This class attempts to address the experience gap that exists across the spectrum of incoming Computer Science students.
While driven by tools (shells, build systems, debuggers, version control), it explores how and why computer scientists interface with computers differently in their day-to-day activities, how to apply principles learned in courses to everyday activities, and ultimately how to be a more efficient user of computing resources.

This course has been adopted as part of the permanent curriculum at the University of Michigan as EECS 201: Computing Pragmatics, an advised co-requisite for first-year EECS majors.
