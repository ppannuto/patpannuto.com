	abstract = {We propose an ultra-low power interconnect bus for
			millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. Using only 4~IO pads,
			the bus minimizes the required chip real estate, enabling
			ultra-small form factors in modular sensor node
			designs. Low power is achieved using a ``clockless''
			design of member nodes while aggressive power gating
			allows an ultra-low power standby mode with only
			53~gates powered on. An integrated wakeup scheme is
			compatible with PMUs that have a special low power
			standby mode. The MBus is fully synthesizable and uses
			robust timing. Implemented in a 3~module system in
			180~nm technology, Mbus achieves 8~nW of standby power
			and 17.5~pJ/bit/chip.

	abstract = {We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones
			and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires.  The
			luminaires---modified to allow rapid, on-off keying---transmit their
			identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical
			pulses.  A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame
			capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image,
			decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine
			the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires.
			Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position
			updates.
			The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of
			emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data
			through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers
			can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical
			transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is
			intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of
			multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's
			image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained
			angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be
			solved with optimization techniques.  We explore the feasibility of
			the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of
			the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a
			practical deployment including usability and scalability, and
			demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and
			more realistic human mobility scenarios.

		We explore the viability of scaling down the software radio in size,
		cost, and power, and show that an index card-sized, sub-\$150, `AA'
		battery-powered system is possible using off-the-shelf components.
		Key to our approach is that we leverage an integrated, reconfigurable,
		flash-based FPGA with a hard ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor which
		simultaneously enables lower power and tighter hardware/soft\-ware
		integration than prior designs.  This architecture allows us to
		implement timing-critical MAC protocols and validate the speculated
		performance of several recent MAC/PHY primitives and protocols
		including Backcast, A-MAC, and Glossy using an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant
		radio implementation that interoperates with commercial radios.  The
		work also identifies several enhancements in the underlying hardware
		components that could improve power, performance, and flexibility.
