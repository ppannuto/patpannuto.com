      increasingly connected. With this connectivity, embedded devices now face
      a more complex attack surface, underscoring the importance of device
      security. Embedded operating systems are able to span diverse application
      and hardware domains because they are highly configurable. This
      flexibility, however, implies that downstream embedded applications may
      be flexible in how they use security features. This paper investigates
      how downstream applications use configurable security features in
      practice. We find that a majority of applications do not alter the
      default configuration provided by their chosen runtime, and as a result,
      do not utilize available security options. Early evidence suggests that
      this under-utilization is due to both runtime and development overhead.

    Traditional embedded systems rely on custom C code deployed in a monolithic firmware image. In these systems, all code must be trusted completely, as any code can directly modify memory or hardware registers. More recently, some embedded OSes have improved security by separating userspace applications from the kernel, using strong hardware isolation in the form of a memory protection unit (MPU). Unfortunately, this design requires either a large trusted computing base (TCB) containing all OS services, or moving many OS services into userspace. The large TCB approach offers no protection against seemingly-correct backdoored code, discouraging the use of kernel code produced by others and complicating security audits. OS services in userspace come at a cost to usability and efficiency. We posit that a model enabling two tiers of trust for kernel code is better suited to modern embedded software practices. In this paper, we present the threat model of the Tock Operating System, which is based on this idea. We compare this threat model to existing security approaches, and show how it provides useful guarantees to different stakeholders.

    We build a prototype energy harvesting setup for a soil microbial fuel cell, measure the amount of power that we can harvest, and use that energy to drive an e-ink display as a representative example of a periodic energy-intensive load.
    Microbial fuel cells are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, especially soil moisture.
    In near-optimal, super moist conditions our cell provides approximately 100\,\uW of power at around 500\,mV, which is ample power over time to power our system several times a day.
    We further explore how cell performance diminishes and recovers with varying moisture levels as well as how cell performance is affected by the load from the energy harvester itself.
    In sum, we find that the confluence of ever lower-power electronics and new understanding of microbial fuel cell design means that ``soil-powered sensors'' are now feasible. There remains, however, significant future work to make these systems reliable and maximally performant.

   This paper defines architectural and operational principles for simple and reliable energy harvesting devices that can be used in service of high-level applications. For many maintenance and monitoring tasks, we propose that it is more valuable to have reliable, trusted affirmations that nothing has changed than it is to know the exact moment that something has failed. This presents an opportunity for a new class of highly reliable, but not necessarily timely, intermittent devices. These are devices that are capable of sending messages at reasonable, fixed intervals (e.g. once an hour or once a day). They cannot activate more often, but they also promise not to activate less often. To establish this reliability, we look to opportunities for energy scavenging that are often ignored as their instantaneous power delivery capability is very limited. However, unlike higher power scavenging opportunities, many of these sources are not intermittent. Such sources may provide less than a microwatt, but their trickle of energy will be continuously, reliably available for months to decades. This enables the creation of devices that can be guaranteed to activate at predictable intervals, which allows for the construction of non-intermittent systems atop intermittent devices.

When performing RF ranging in a complex indoor environment, the error of a

SurePoint ranging protocols is that individual nodes can efficiently capture
multiple independent samples of the RF channel. For each point in space, nodes
capture twenty seven independent samples by varying the spectrum sampled and
the polarization of antennas. This dataset includes all of the measurements
reported in the PolyPoint and SurePoint papers, which comprises several
thousand points in a complex indoor environment. Precise 3D coordinates of
nodes were captured using an optical motion capture system calibrated to

   Embedded systems have long been synonymous with special purpose, single
   stakeholder computing. However, as these systems have become more capable and
   the demands placed on them have become more varied and variable, embedded
   software is beginning to embrace multi-tenancy.
   While the general problem of supporting multiple users and processes on a
   computing platform has been well explored in computer science, the
   challenges of supporting multiple users with competing desires on a highly
   energy-variable system remain unexplored.
   On an energy-harvesting platform, incoming energy needs to be distributed
   between stakeholders, and users accessing shared platform resources should
   be charged for the energy use of those resources.
   Furthermore, with system designers and application creators being
   increasingly removed from each other, the software environments of
   energy-harvesting platforms must provide primitives that enable applications
   to adapt to system variability.
   We explore several initial techniques for solving these problems and
   demonstrate them using Signpost---a modular, energy-harvesting platform for
   city-scale sensing.

  abstract = {After years of development, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and
  long-lasting solid-state lighting technology is finally a viable alternative
  to incandescent and fluorescent lights.  Unfortunately, the remarkable march
  of semiconductor technology into the lighting industry is almost entirely in
  the form of a substitute good---one kind of lighting technology that replaces
  another---but this, we argue, squanders a unique opportunity for lighting to
  enable a bevy of new applications.  In this paper, we discuss applications in
  health, energy efficiency, entertainment, communications, indoor positioning,
  device configuration, and time synchronization.  We then prototype several of
  the indoor applications to explore a {\em software-defined lighting} (SDL)
  architecture that could support them.

  Using our prototyped applications, we next take a primitive stab at
  demonstrating application coexistence, multiplexing multiple applications on
  a single lighting network.  A major question raised by this effort is how to
  multiplex these various applications in a more principled manner on a shared
  lighting infrastructure whose primary role is illumination (implying that any
  human-perceptible flicker or flashing will be unacceptable).
  Looking ahead, we draw inspiration from software-defined networking's
  approach to sharing the network, and software-defined radios' approach to
  processing waveforms, to sketch the beginnings of an SDL architecture and its
  application programming interfaces.

	 undertakings and it is essential in developed and developing nations
		 alike.  Currently, transparency into the power grid relies on
		 utility companies and more fine-grained insight is provided by
		 costly smart meter deployments. We claim that greater
		 visibility into power grid conditions can be provided in an
		 inexpensive and crowd-sourced manner independent of utility
		 companies by leveraging existing smartphones.  Our key insight
		 is that an unmodified smartphone can detect power outages by
		 monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying
		 these outages using a variety of sensors that reduce the
		 likelihood of false power outage reports, and corroborating
		 actual reports with other phones through data aggregation in
		 the cloud.  The proposed approach enables a decentralized
		 system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and
		 concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the
		 power grid and hold utility companies accountable for poor
		 power quality.  This paper demonstrates the viability of the
		 basic idea, identifies a number of challenges that are
		 specific to this application as well as ones that are common
		 to many crowd-sourced applications, and highlights some
		 improvements to smartphone operating systems that could better

		The SmartGrid is ushering in an era of new IP endpoints that already
		reside on the power grid today, but lack network connectivity.  Many
		of these endpoints -- refrigerators, air conditioners, and power
		strips -- will be networked wirelessly.  However, since they already
		exist on the power grid, a natural question is whether they might be
		networked over the same wires that supply their power.  Such an
		approach would allow SmartGrid sensors to vacate increasingly
		congested spectrum and allow information to flow along the same path
		as power, perhaps simplifying deployment in the short term and deep
		demand response in the long term.
		In this paper we explore the current state of Powerline Communications
		(PLC) and explore the efficacy of PLC as a sensor network backbone in
		a modern building.  We evaluate several different PLC modems in both
		end-to-end and multi-hop configurations.  We further analyze building
		blueprints to identify and correlate several PLC ``disruptors'' --
		building facets that inhibit PLC.  Our preliminary results show that
		PLC is a promising technology for networking sensors in the Smart
		Building.  However, a number of anomalies suggest a more in-depth
		study is warranted.
