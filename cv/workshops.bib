    On average, wireless electronics devices are replaced every 50~months.
    On average, a bridge is replaced every 50~years.
    As we begin to imagine integrating electronics and intelligence into the built environment, we need to to begin to think about electronic devices and systems on infrastructure timelines.
    This is not to say that every individual electronic device can, will, or should last for decades, but much like the ship of Theseus, the \emph{system} that defines emerging Smart Cities will have a lifetime reaching into the century-scale.
    In this paper, we contemplate what the devices, gateways, network architectures, and their management might look like for a system designed to operate for decades.
    The result is a mixture of actionable insights for today and research questions for tomorrow, which culminates in the commencement of a 50-year experiment designed to see how long energy-harvesting sensors, without the implicit lifetime of batteries, can remain viable without human attention or intervention.

    Reproducibility and replicability (R\&R) are important for research.
    Many communities are beginning efforts to reward, incentivize, and highlight projects as a motive to adopt R\&R practices.
    This is clearly a good direction -- we should all aim to make our research sound, replicable, and reproducible.
    Yet, this involves a lot of effort to document, debug, and generally make the systems that we build more usable.
    Interfacing with the
    \emph{Physical} world and building custom \emph{Things} exacerbates these
    challenges.
    Therein lies the dilemma: how does the CPS/IoT community reward and incentivize R\&R efforts?
    This paper looks into the question of R\&R in CPS/IoT.
    We survey efforts in other fields spanning computing to healthcare and
    highlight similarities and differences to CPS/IoT.
    We then discuss several exemplar CPS/IoT projects related to UCSD's research and
    highlight the R\&R efforts in these projects, the potential ways that they
    could be improved, and best practices.
    We finish with recommendations and insights for R\&R tailored to the CPS/IoT
    community.

   This paper defines architectural and operational principles for simple and reliable energy harvesting devices that can be used in service of high-level applications. For many maintenance and monitoring tasks, we propose that it is more valuable to have reliable, trusted affirmations that nothing has changed than it is to know the exact moment that something has failed. This presents an opportunity for a new class of highly reliable, but not necessarily timely, intermittent devices. These are devices that are capable of sending messages at reasonable, fixed intervals (e.g. once an hour or once a day). They cannot activate more often, but they also promise not to activate less often. To establish this reliability, we look to opportunities for energy scavenging that are often ignored as their instantaneous power delivery capability is very limited. However, unlike higher power scavenging opportunities, many of these sources are not intermittent. Such sources may provide less than a microwatt, but their trickle of energy will be continuously, reliably available for months to decades. This enables the creation of devices that can be guaranteed to activate at predictable intervals, which allows for the construction of non-intermittent systems atop intermittent devices.

When performing RF ranging in a complex indoor environment, the error of a
single channel estimate can vary widely. A key insight of the PolyPoint and
SurePoint ranging protocols is that individual nodes can efficiently capture
multiple independent samples of the RF channel. For each point in space, nodes
capture twenty seven independent samples by varying the spectrum sampled and
the polarization of antennas. This dataset includes all of the measurements
reported in the PolyPoint and SurePoint papers, which comprises several
thousand points in a complex indoor environment. Precise 3D coordinates of
nodes were captured using an optical motion capture system calibrated to
millimeter accuracy. Several tracking studies are included, with continuous
samples over time as a node moves through the environment.

   Embedded systems have long been synonymous with special purpose, single
   stakeholder computing. However, as these systems have become more capable and
   the demands placed on them have become more varied and variable, embedded
   software is beginning to embrace multi-tenancy.
   While the general problem of supporting multiple users and processes on a
   computing platform has been well explored in computer science, the
   challenges of supporting multiple users with competing desires on a highly
   energy-variable system remain unexplored.
   On an energy-harvesting platform, incoming energy needs to be distributed
   between stakeholders, and users accessing shared platform resources should
   be charged for the energy use of those resources.
   Furthermore, with system designers and application creators being
   increasingly removed from each other, the software environments of
   energy-harvesting platforms must provide primitives that enable applications
   to adapt to system variability.
   We explore several initial techniques for solving these problems and
   demonstrate them using Signpost---a modular, energy-harvesting platform for
   city-scale sensing.

 abstract = {Decades of research has attempted to add safety mechanisms to
   operating system kernels, but this effort has failed in most practical
     systems. In particular, solutions that sacrifice performance have been
     generally avoided. However, isolation techniques in modern languages can
     provide safety while avoiding performance issues. Moreover, utilizing a
     type-safe language with no garbage collector or other runtime services
     avoids what would otherwise be some of the largest sections of trusted
     code base. We report on our experiences in writing a resource efficient
     embedded kernel in Rust, finding that only a small set of unsafe
     abstractions are necessary in order to form common kernel building blocks.
     Further, we argue that Rust's choice to avoid runtime memory management by
     using a linear type system will enable the next generation of safe
     operating systems.
