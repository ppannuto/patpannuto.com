  abstract = {We introduce {\em Harmonia}, a new RF-based localization scheme
		that provides the simplicity, cost, and power advantages of
		  traditional narrowband radios with the decimeter-scale
		  accuracy of ultra wideband localization techniques. Harmonia is
		  an asymmetric {\em tag} and {\em anchor} system, requiring
		  minimal modifications to existing low-power wireless devices
		  to support high-fidelity localization with comparatively
		  modest infrastructure costs.  A prototype Harmonia design offers
		  location estimates with an average-case error of 53.4~cm in
		  complex, heavy-multipath, indoor environments and captures
		  location estimates at 56~Hz while requiring only 1.7~mA
		  additional power draw for each tag and complying with all
		  US~UWB regulations.  We believe this architecture's
		  combination of accuracy, update rate, power draw, and system
		  complexity will lead to a new point in the design space.

  abstract = {After years of development, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and
  long-lasting solid-state lighting technology is finally a viable alternative
  to incandescent and fluorescent lights.  Unfortunately, the remarkable march
  of semiconductor technology into the lighting industry is almost entirely in
  the form of a substitute good---one kind of lighting technology that replaces
  another---but this, we argue, squanders a unique opportunity for lighting to
  enable a bevy of new applications.  In this paper, we discuss applications in
  health, energy efficiency, entertainment, communications, indoor positioning,
  device configuration, and time synchronization.  We then prototype several of
  the indoor applications to explore a {\em software-defined lighting} (SDL)
  architecture that could support them.

  Using our prototyped applications, we next take a primitive stab at
  demonstrating application coexistence, multiplexing multiple applications on
  a single lighting network.  A major question raised by this effort is how to
  multiplex these various applications in a more principled manner on a shared
  lighting infrastructure whose primary role is illumination (implying that any
  human-perceptible flicker or flashing will be unacceptable).
  Looking ahead, we draw inspiration from software-defined networking's
  approach to sharing the network, and software-defined radios' approach to
  processing waveforms, to sketch the beginnings of an SDL architecture and its
  application programming interfaces.

	 undertakings and it is essential in developed and developing nations

		 visibility into power grid conditions can be provided in an
		 inexpensive and crowd-sourced manner independent of utility
		 companies by leveraging existing smartphones.  Our key insight
		 is that an unmodified smartphone can detect power outages by
		 monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying
		 these outages using a variety of sensors that reduce the
		 likelihood of false power outage reports, and corroborating
		 actual reports with other phones through data aggregation in
		 the cloud.  The proposed approach enables a decentralized
		 system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and
		 concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the
		 power grid and hold utility companies accountable for poor
		 power quality.  This paper demonstrates the viability of the
		 basic idea, identifies a number of challenges that are
		 specific to this application as well as ones that are common
		 to many crowd-sourced applications, and highlights some
		 improvements to smartphone operating systems that could better

		The SmartGrid is ushering in an era of new IP endpoints that already
		reside on the power grid today, but lack network connectivity.  Many
		of these endpoints -- refrigerators, air conditioners, and power
		strips -- will be networked wirelessly.  However, since they already
		exist on the power grid, a natural question is whether they might be
		networked over the same wires that supply their power.  Such an
		approach would allow SmartGrid sensors to vacate increasingly
		congested spectrum and allow information to flow along the same path
		as power, perhaps simplifying deployment in the short term and deep
		demand response in the long term.
		In this paper we explore the current state of Powerline Communications
		(PLC) and explore the efficacy of PLC as a sensor network backbone in
		a modern building.  We evaluate several different PLC modems in both
		end-to-end and multi-hop configurations.  We further analyze building
		blueprints to identify and correlate several PLC ``disruptors'' --
		building facets that inhibit PLC.  Our preliminary results show that
		PLC is a promising technology for networking sensors in the Smart
		Building.  However, a number of anomalies suggest a more in-depth
		study is warranted.
