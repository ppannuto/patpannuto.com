	abstract = {We propose an ultra-low power interconnect bus for
			millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. Using only 4~IO pads,
			the bus minimizes the required chip real estate, enabling
			ultra-small form factors in modular sensor node
			designs. Low power is achieved using a ``clockless''
			design of member nodes while aggressive power gating
			allows an ultra-low power standby mode with only
			53~gates powered on. An integrated wakeup scheme is
			compatible with PMUs that have a special low power
			standby mode. The MBus is fully synthesizable and uses
			robust timing. Implemented in a 3~module system in
			180~nm technology, Mbus achieves 8~nW of standby power
			and 17.5~pJ/bit/chip.

	abstract = {We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones
			and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires.  The
			luminaires---modified to allow rapid, on-off keying---transmit their
			identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical
			pulses.  A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame
			capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image,
			decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine
			the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires.
			Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position
			updates.
			The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of
			emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data
			through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers
			can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical
			transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is
			intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of
			multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's
			image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained
			angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be
			solved with optimization techniques.  We explore the feasibility of
			the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of
			the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a
			practical deployment including usability and scalability, and
			demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and
			more realistic human mobility scenarios.

 abstract = {The power grid is one of humanity's most significant engineering
	 undertakings and it is essential in developed and developing nations
		 alike.  Currently, transparency into the power grid relies on
		 utility companies and more fine-grained insight is provided by
		 costly smart meter deployments. We claim that greater
		 visibility into power grid conditions can be provided in an
		 inexpensive and crowd-sourced manner independent of utility
		 companies by leveraging existing smartphones.  Our key insight
		 is that an unmodified smartphone can detect power outages by
		 monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying
		 these outages using a variety of sensors that reduce the
		 likelihood of false power outage reports, and corroborating
		 actual reports with other phones through data aggregation in
		 the cloud.  The proposed approach enables a decentralized
		 system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and
		 concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the
		 power grid and hold utility companies accountable for poor
		 power quality.  This paper demonstrates the viability of the
		 basic idea, identifies a number of challenges that are
		 specific to this application as well as ones that are common
		 to many crowd-sourced applications, and highlights some
		 improvements to smartphone operating systems that could better
		 support such applications in the future.},

The sensor platform benefits from modularity by allowing the addition/removal of IC layers. A new low power I$^2$C interface is introduced for energy efficient inter-layer communication with compatibility to commercial I$^2$C protocols. A self-adapting power management unit is proposed for efficient battery voltage down conversion for wide range of battery voltages and load current. The power management unit also adapts itself by monitoring energy harvesting conditions and harvesting sources and is capable of harvesting from solar, thermal and microbial fuel cells. An optical wakeup receiver is proposed for sensor node programming and synchronization with 228~pW standby power. The system also includes two processors, timer, temperature sensor, and low-power imager. Standby power of the system is 11~nW.},
