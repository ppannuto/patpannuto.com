  abstract = {Social scientists, psychologists, and epidemiologists use empirical human interaction data to research human behaviour, social bonding, and disease spread. Historically, systems measuring interactions have been forced to choose between deployability and measurement fidelity---they operate only in instrumented spaces, under line-of-sight conditions, or provide coarse-grained proximity data. We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.},

  abstract={
    The vision of sensor systems that collect critical and previously ungathered
      information about the world is often only realized when sensors, students,
    and subjects move outside the academic laboratory. However, deployments at
      even the smallest scales introduce complexities and risks that can be
      difficult for a research team to anticipate. Over the past year, our
      interdisciplinary team of engineers and economists has been designing,
    deploying, and operating a large sensor network in Accra, Ghana that
      measures power outages and quality at households and firms. This network
      consists of 457 custom sensors, over 3,000 mobile app instances,
    thousands of participant surveys, and custom user incentive and
      deployment management systems. In part, this deployment supports an
      evaluation of the impacts of investments in the grid on reliability and
      the subsequent effects of improvements in reliability on
      socioeconomic well-being. We report our experiences as we move from
      performing small pilot deployments to our current scale, attempting to
      identify the pain points at each stage of the deployment. Finally, we
      extract high-level observations and lessons learned from our
      deployment activities, which we wish we had originally known when
      forecasting budgets, human resources, and project timelines. These
      insights will be critical as we look toward scaling our deployment to the
      en-tire city of Accra and beyond, and we hope that they will encourage and
      support other researchers looking to measure highly granular information
      about our world’s critical systems.

Incentives are a key facet of human studies research, yet the state-of-the-art
often designs and implements incentive systems in an ad-hoc, on-demand manner.
We introduce the first vocabulary for formally describing incentive
systems and develop a software infrastructure that enables UI-based graphical
generation of complex, auditable, reliable, and reproducible incentive systems.
We call this infrastructure the Open INcentive Kit (OINK).
A review of recent literature from several communities finds that of the one hundred and twenty-one publications that incorporate
incentives, only thirty-one describe their incentive system in detail, and all of these could be implemented using OINK. We evaluate OINK in practice by using it for an active energy monitoring deployment in Ghana and find that OINK successfully facilitates thousands of individual incentive payments. Finally, we describe our efforts to generalize OINK for different research communities, specifically focusing on architectural decisions around extensibility to support unanticipated use cases. OINK is free and open-source software.

Smart and connected devices offer enormous potential to enable
context-aware, localized, and multi-device orchestrations that could
substantially increase the reach and utility of computing.  The growth
of these applications has been hampered, however, as devices, their
data, and their control have been largely sequestered to their own
vendor-specific APIs, clouds, and applications---a largely stove-piped
state of affairs.  In instances where barriers between devices have
been pierced, the connections often occur between vendor clouds,
affecting the latency, privacy, and reliability of the original
application, while simultaneously making them more complex.  Locally
executing applications have not materialized as devices with
incompatible communication protocols, inconsistent APIs, and
incongruent data models rarely communicate. We claim that what is
needed to unlock the application potential is an architecture tailored
to facilitating applications composed of networked devices.

Our proposed architecture addresses this by providing a port-based abstraction
for devices using a small wrapper layer. This device abstraction
provides a consistent view of devices, and embeddable runtimes provide existing
applications straightforward access to devices. The architecture also supports
device discovery, shared interfaces between devices, and an application
specification interface that promotes creating device-agnostic applications
capable of operating even when devices change.  We demonstrate the efficacy of
our architecture with two application case studies that highlight the
abstraction layers between applications and devices and employ the
embeddability of our system to add new functionality to existing systems.

    Network connectivity is often one of the most challenging aspects of deploying
    sensors. In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable,

    withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of
    permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones

Ultra wideband technology has shown great promise for providing
high-quality location estimation, even in complex indoor multipath
environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of
milliwatts during operation.
Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly
low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to
narrowband systems with low localization resolution.
The challenge to combining these complimentary technologies is that they
share a compounding limitation, constrained transmit power. Regulations limit
ultra wideband transmissions to just -41.3\,dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device
can only reflect the power it receives.
The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting the
initially imperceptible signal out of the noise.
This integration only works while the target is stationary. However, stationary
describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones.
With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt,
decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in
localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites
the localization of every thing.
To evaluate this concept,
we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that
Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter
in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space
and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30\,cm.

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling a deeper understanding of our
urban environments.
However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation,
power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a
good idea and a realized one.
This indicates the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and
experimentation for applications operating at city scale.
To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular, energy-harvesting platform for city-scale sensing.
Signpost simplifies deployment by eliminating the need
for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an
integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to 
support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing
fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of dynamic energy constraints.
We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability
of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its
ability to support sensing applications.
We believe Signpost reduces the difficulty inherent in city-scale deployments,
enables new experimentation, and provides improved insights into urban health.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary
for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of
frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median
ranging error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and
fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08\,m median error
and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next
develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme
compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the
viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband
radios.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than
42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

			application space, poised to become the largest
			electronics market for the semiconductor industry. IoT
			devices are focused on sensing and actuating of our

			breadth of uses. In this paper, we explore the IoT
			application space and then identify two common
			challenges that exist across this space: ultra-low
			power operation and system design using modular,
			composable components. We survey recent low power
			techniques and discuss a low power bus that enables
			modular design. Finally, we conclude with three example
			ultra-low power, millimeter-scale IoT systems.

	abstract = {Most modern software-defined radios are large, expensive, and
		power-hungry, and this diminishes their utility in low-power,
		size-constrained settings like sensor networks and mobile computing.
		We explore the viability of scaling down the software radio in size,
		cost, and power, and show that an index card-sized, sub-\$150, `AA'
		battery-powered system is possible using off-the-shelf components.
		Key to our approach is that we leverage an integrated, reconfigurable,
		flash-based FPGA with a hard ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor which
		simultaneously enables lower power and tighter hardware/soft\-ware
		integration than prior designs.  This architecture allows us to
		implement timing-critical MAC protocols and validate the speculated
		performance of several recent MAC/PHY primitives and protocols
		including Backcast, A-MAC, and Glossy using an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant
		radio implementation that interoperates with commercial radios.  The
		work also identifies several enhancements in the underlying hardware
		components that could improve power, performance, and flexibility.
