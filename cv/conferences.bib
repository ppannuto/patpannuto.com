   developed by academics to help other academics build urban
   sensing applications. By leveraging a new language (Rust)
   and new hardware protection mechanisms, Tock enabled

   while remaining a platform for operating systems research.
   This paper focuses on the impact of Tock's technical design
   on its adoption, the challenges and unexpected benefits
   of using a type-safe language (Rust)---particularly in
   security-sensitive settings---and the experience of supporting a

 abstract = {Memory- and type-safe languages promise to eliminate
entire classes of systems vulnerabilities by construction. In
practice, though, even clean-slate systems often need to incorporate
libraries written in other languages with fewer safety
guarantees. Because these interactions threaten the soundness
of safe languages, they can reintroduce the exact vulnerabilities
that safe languages prevent in the first place.

This paper presents Omniglot: the first framework to efficiently
uphold safety and soundness of Rust in the presence
of unmodified and untrusted foreign libraries. Omniglot facilitates
interactions with foreign code by integrating with a
memory isolation primitive and validation infrastructure, and
avoids expensive operations such as copying or serialization.

We implement Omniglot for two systems: we use it to integrate
kernel components in a highly-constrained embedded operating
system kernel, as well as to interface with conventional
Linux userspace libraries. Omniglot performs comparably
to approaches that deliver weaker guarantees and significantly
better than those with similar safety guarantees.

Most of these unwanted smartphones are neither discarded nor recycled but languish in junk drawers and storage units. This computational stockpile represents a substantial wasted potential: modern smartphones have increasingly high-performance and energy-efficient processors, extensive networking capabilities, and a reliable built-in power supply. This project studies the ability to reuse smartphones as "junkyard computers." Junkyard computers grow global computing capacity by extending device lifetimes, which supplants the manufacture of new devices. We show that the capabilities of even decade-old smartphones are within those demanded by modern cloud microservices and discuss how to combine phones to perform increasingly complex tasks. We describe how current operation-focused metrics do not capture the actual carbon costs of compute. We propose Computational Carbon Intensity---a performance metric that balances the continued service of older devices with the superlinear runtime improvements of newer machines. We use this metric to redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones. We analyze the carbon benefits of deploying large, end-to-end microservice-based applications on these smartphones. Finally, we describe system architectures and associated challenges to scale to cloudlets with hundreds and thousands of smartphones.},

   In this paper, we provide the first broad measurement study of the operation, adoption, performance, and efficacy of Helium.
   The Helium network aims to provide low-power, wide-area network wireless
coverage for Internet of Things-class devices.
   In contrast to traditional infrastructure, ``hotspots'' (base stations) are owned and
operated by individuals who are paid by the network for
providing coverage and are paid directly by users for ferrying data.

   As of May, 2021, Helium has over 40,000 active hotspots with 1,000 new hotspots coming online every day.
   This deployment is decentralized -- 84\% of users own at most three hotspots.
   Some support infrastructure remains highly centralized, however, with over 99\% of data traffic routed through one cloud endpoint and multiple cities in which all hotspots rely on one ISP for backhaul.
   Helium is largely speculative today with more hotspot activity than user activity.
   Crowdsourced, incentive-guided infrastructure deployment largely works but shows evidence of gamification and apathy.
   As Helium lacks clear, radio-oriented coverage maps, we develop and test coverage models based on network incentives.
   Finally, empirical testing with IoT devices finds basic success, but uncovers numerous reliability issues.

  Generally, infrastructure is susceptible to, and therefore must

  The monitoring and maintenance of
  corrosion protection (or the consequences of its unchecked failure) is often
  one of the leading costs of infrastructure upkeep.
  Galvanic cathodic protection is a common corrosion control technique
  that is employed in applications from home appliances to boats to bridges.
  At its core, however, galvanic cathodic protection is simply an
  electrochemical cell---that is, a battery.
  This presents an opportunity to treat this corrosion protection as an
  in-situ power source that \emph{by definition} will last as long as the
  protection system itself.
  In this paper, we explore the efficacy of these pervasive, ``ambient
  galvanic cells'' as potential energy harvesting sources.
  We then show how to use these cells as a power source for wireless sensing
  devices that monitor the health of the same corrosion protection system.
  Our system takes advantage of newly available LPWAN technologies that allow
  for effortless wide-area coverage.
  We demonstrate the viability and efficacy of the system on one of the most
  common galvanic cathodic protection systems, home hot water heaters.
  We show that this technique can be a powerful new asset for corrosion
  monitoring and for deploying wireless sensor networks broadly.

We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery.

    The vision of sensor systems that collect critical and previously ungathered

      interdisciplinary team of engineers and economists has been designing,
    deploying, and operating a large sensor network in Accra, Ghana that
      measures power outages and quality at households and firms. This network
      consists of 457 custom sensors, over 3,000 mobile app instances,
    thousands of participant surveys, and custom user incentive and
      deployment management systems. In part, this deployment supports an
      evaluation of the impacts of investments in the grid on reliability and
      the subsequent effects of improvements in reliability on
      socioeconomic well-being. We report our experiences as we move from

Incentives are a key facet of human studies research, yet the state-of-the-art

We introduce the first vocabulary for formally describing incentive
systems and develop a software infrastructure that enables UI-based graphical
generation of complex, auditable, reliable, and reproducible incentive systems.
We call this infrastructure the Open INcentive Kit (OINK).
A review of recent literature from several communities finds that of the one hundred and twenty-one publications that incorporate
incentives, only thirty-one describe their incentive system in detail, and all of these could be implemented using OINK. We evaluate OINK in practice by using it for an active energy monitoring deployment in Ghana and find that OINK successfully facilitates thousands of individual incentive payments. Finally, we describe our efforts to generalize OINK for different research communities, specifically focusing on architectural decisions around extensibility to support unanticipated use cases. OINK is free and open-source software.

Smart and connected devices offer enormous potential to enable
context-aware, localized, and multi-device orchestrations that could
substantially increase the reach and utility of computing.  The growth
of these applications has been hampered, however, as devices, their
data, and their control have been largely sequestered to their own
vendor-specific APIs, clouds, and applications---a largely stove-piped
state of affairs.  In instances where barriers between devices have
been pierced, the connections often occur between vendor clouds,
affecting the latency, privacy, and reliability of the original
application, while simultaneously making them more complex.  Locally
executing applications have not materialized as devices with
incompatible communication protocols, inconsistent APIs, and
incongruent data models rarely communicate. We claim that what is
needed to unlock the application potential is an architecture tailored
to facilitating applications composed of networked devices.

Our proposed architecture addresses this by providing a port-based abstraction
for devices using a small wrapper layer. This device abstraction
provides a consistent view of devices, and embeddable runtimes provide existing
applications straightforward access to devices. The architecture also supports
device discovery, shared interfaces between devices, and an application
specification interface that promotes creating device-agnostic applications
capable of operating even when devices change.  We demonstrate the efficacy of
our architecture with two application case studies that highlight the
abstraction layers between applications and devices and employ the
embeddability of our system to add new functionality to existing systems.

    Network connectivity is often one of the most challenging aspects of deploying
    sensors. In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable,
    highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for internet access. While this makes smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud,

    withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of
    permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones

Ultra wideband technology has shown great promise for providing
high-quality location estimation, even in complex indoor multipath
environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of
milliwatts during operation.
Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly
low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to
narrowband systems with low localization resolution.
The challenge to combining these complimentary technologies is that they
share a compounding limitation, constrained transmit power. Regulations limit
ultra wideband transmissions to just -41.3\,dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device
can only reflect the power it receives.
The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting the
initially imperceptible signal out of the noise.
This integration only works while the target is stationary. However, stationary
describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones.
With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt,
decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in
localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites
the localization of every thing.
To evaluate this concept,
we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that
Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter
in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space
and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30\,cm.

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling a deeper understanding of our
urban environments.
However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation,
power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a
good idea and a realized one.
This indicates the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and
experimentation for applications operating at city scale.
To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular, energy-harvesting platform for city-scale sensing.
Signpost simplifies deployment by eliminating the need
for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an
integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to 
support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing
fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of dynamic energy constraints.
We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability
of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its
ability to support sensing applications.
We believe Signpost reduces the difficulty inherent in city-scale deployments,
enables new experimentation, and provides improved insights into urban health.

 abstract = {Low-power microcontrollers lack some of the hardware features and
     memory resources that enable multiprogrammable systems.  Accordingly,
     microcontroller-based operating systems have not provided important
     features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and
     flexible concurrency. However, an emerging class of embedded
     applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose
     devices, and need these multiprogramming features.  Tock, a new
     operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited
     hardware-protection mechanisms as well as the type-safety features of the
     Rust programming language to provide a multiprogramming environment
     for microcontrollers.  Tock isolates software faults, provides
     memory protection, and efficiently manages memory for dynamic
     application workloads written in any language. It achieves this while
     retaining the dependability requirements of long-running applications.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary
for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of
frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median
ranging error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and
fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08\,m median error
and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next
develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme
compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the
viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband
radios.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than
42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

			factor in scaling down size and power toward the goal of
			invisible computing. Achieving this goal will require
			composing optimized and specialized---yet
			reusable---components with an interconnect that permits
			tiny, ultra-low power systems.  In contrast to today's
			interconnects which are limited by power-hungry
			pull-ups or high-overhead chip-select lines, our
			approach provides a superset of common bus features but
			at lower power, with fixed area and pin count, using
			fully synthesizable logic, and with surprisingly low
			protocol overhead.

			We present \textbf{MBus}, a new 4-pin,
			22.6\,pJ/bit/chip chip-to-chip interconnect made of two
			``shoot-through'' rings.  MBus facilitates ultra-low
			power system operation by implementing automatic
			power-gating of each chip in the system, easing the
			integration of active, inactive, and activating
			circuits on a single die.  In addition, we introduce a
			new bus primitive: power oblivious communication, which
			guarantees message reception regardless of the
			recipient's power state when a message is sent.  This
			disentangles power management from communication,
			greatly simplifying the creation of viable, modular,
			and heterogeneous systems that operate on the order of
			nanowatts.

			To evaluate the viability, power, performance,
			overhead, and scalability of our design, we build both
			hardware and software implementations of MBus and show
			its seamless operation across two FPGAs and twelve
			custom chips from three different semiconductor
			processes.  A three-chip, 2.2\,mm$^3$ MBus system draws
			8\,nW of total system standby power and uses only
			22.6\,pJ/bit/chip for communication.  This is the
			lowest power for any system bus with MBus's feature
			set.

		Opo sensors range neighbors every 2~s up to 2~m away with 5\% average

		The cornerstone of Opo is an ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 19~\uA
		when no neighbors are present. This enables Opo sensors to discover and range
		neighbors without the need for infrastructure nodes and slow or power-hungry

		Thus, Opo is able to sense interaction distance with high accuracy (5~cm)
