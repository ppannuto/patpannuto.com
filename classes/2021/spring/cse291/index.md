## Overview

Researchers, policy makers, citizen scientists, and curious individuals have
an innumerable array of questions about the world around them.  How does
physical proximity affect disease transmission?  What changes would have the
greatest impact on the carbon footprint of an urban environment?  What is the
historical air quality like for asthmatics in the neighborhoods where I am
shopping for houses? This course is about the design and implementation of
platforms and systems capable of capturing the data to answer such questions.

Formally, this is the study of embedded systems and wireless sensor networks.
These are computing systems that are deployed widely in the physical world,
which creates unique constraints in their physical size, deployment,
management, communication, energy availability, and operation. We will begin
with a history of impactful deployments, then study each of the pieces in
turn, both traditional sensor architectures and more exotic designs such as
energy harvesting systems, synchronous wirelss communication, and how to do
machine learning with less than 1 MB of memory.

### Target Audience

The intended audience of this course is PhD students or masters students who
are interested in pursuing a PhD in the future.
This is a research-oriented class. It's designed to bring people up to speed on
the history as well as the state of the art in mobile computing and to gain
experience with the design, early implementation, and evaluation of a research
idea.



<!--
### Prerequisites

Experience equivalent of an undergraduate degree in any of Electrical
Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Data Science, Information
Science, or related areas.  This is a vertical slice through the computing
stack, and we will touch on topics from programming languages and distributed
systems down to circuits and wireless. An enthusiasm and willingness to learn a
little about a lot of new things is far more important than any one specific
background.

The goal is to have a fairly diverse course with folks from different and
complimentary backgrounds. We'll cover topics in each of these areas, but you
are **not** expected to be familiar with all of them.

If you are comfortable with **just one** of these, and are interested in
learning a little about the rest, welcome!

 - Operating Systems
 - Programming Languages (especially systems-oriented ones)
 - Networking
 - Wireless Communication
 - Architecture
-->


## Syllabus

This class is made of three co-equal components: pre-class reviews, in-class
participation, and a quarter-long project.

### Paper Reviews

Before each class you must read each paper and then write a short review.
This should be more than a simple summary of the paper. Here are some questions
to consider while reading and writing your reviews to help guide you:

 - What is the problem this paper addresses, and why is it important?
 - What is the hypothesis of this paper?
 - How was this hypothesis evaluated? What supported it, what refuted it?
 - What are the limits of this system (when does it fail)?
 - What is this most similar to that you are already familiar with; how does it compare, differ?
 - At what point did you decide you liked &ndash; or didn't like &ndash; the paper, **why?**


#### Submitting Reviews

We will use the [HotCRP review system](https://ucsd-cse291-a00-s20.hotcrp.com)
&ndash; the same tool used by many conferences to review papers.

Reviews are due the day before class.
HotCRP will automatically cut off submissions at 12:01am on the morning of class.
We will create accounts for all enrolled students during the first week of classes.
If you need an account or have other issues, please
<a href="mailto:ppannuto@ucsd.edu?subject=CSE291-K00-W20%20HotCRP%20Issue">e-mail me</a>.

### Participation

We will rotate through class members to lead discussion each session. Leads
should be prepared to give an overview of the paper's key ideas and to guide a
discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, how it relates to
prior and/or subsequent work, and what the core takeaway(s) of the paper may
be.

When not the lead, everyone else is expected to have read the papers and to
actively participate in the class discussions.

### Class Project

This class will feature a quarter long project of your own choosing. Project
scope should be commensurate with group size &ndash; an individual project is
acceptable, though advised against. A core goal of the project is to
demonstrate mastery of the scientific method: namely to clearly articulate a
hypothesis and to design and implement experiments that (in)validate the
hypothesis (note: a project with a negative result may still be a highly
successful project!). The goal of the project is to learn how to propose a
research idea, to then collect preliminary data to probe the viability of that
idea, and finally to practice communicating this process in writing.

The project will have three milestones:

<dl>
  <dt>Week 3</dt>
  <dd>Monday, April 12: One to two page proposal writeup that includes your hypothesis, motivation, and at least one experiment you intend to run.</dd>
  <dt>Week 6</dt>
  <dd>Monday, May 3: Three to four page draft that includes a literature review ("Related Work"), proposed experiments, and their expected outcomes.</dd>
  <dt>Week 10</dt>
  <dd>Tuesday, June 1: Final five to six page paper that includes outcome of small-scale experiments / prototype / etc. This should resemble an early-to-mature draft of an academic workshop paper.</dd>
</dl>



<!--
    What is the problem this paper addresses, and why is it important?
    What is the hypothesis of this paper?

    What are the two main weaknesses of this paper?
    Which figure or experiment was most compelling in support of the hypothesis, and why?

    What is the problem the paper addresses?
    Why is the problem important?
    What is the proposed solution?
    What were the challenges that the authors faced?
    How did the authors evaluate their solution?
    What falls outside the scope of this paper?

### Final Exam / Presentations

Instead of a final exam, we will have a "mini-conference" where each project
will give a conference-style presentation on their research project.

<!--          FI   06/07/21   M   03:00 P  05:59 P                         -->

We will use the final exam slot for presentations.
The class has been assigned a final exam timeslot of 3-6pm, Monday, June 7th.


Some guidelines for your presentation:

 * Length:
    * For 1-person teams, target around 8:00 minutes in length (no shorter than 6:00, no longer than 12:00).
    * For 2-person teams, target around 10:00 minutes in length (no shorter than 8:00, no longer than 15:00).
 * Ideally should include a demo component that highlights the system you have built in operation. Take some time with this (around 2:00)! Show off your hard work and all the cool things it does!
 * Try to tell a story with your presentation. Here is one rough template (you do **not** have to follow this precisely, it is simply an example of how to organize such a presentation):
    * Begin with an introduction that lays out the problem and *why* it is important [about 1:00]
    * Then, succinctly explain *what* you actually built/did [about 0:30]
        * _What is the hypothesis you are exploring in this work?_
    * [Demo opportunity here]
    * Next, look at some of the related work in this problem space, how does your solution differ from what came before? What ideas do you build on? [about 1:00]
    * After that, look at *how* you designed your system. What tradeoffs did you have to consider in your design, what choices did you make in how to build your system and why did your make those choices? [about 2:00]
    * Now, answer the question *does it work*. Talk about how you evaluated your system (and *why* that is a reasonable evaluation); compare this with prior systems if appropriate [about 2:30]
    * [Demo opportunity here]
    * Finally, what is the impact and result of this work? Tie back to your hypothesis. What questions might someone interested in this want to explore further? [about 1:00]
    * [Demo opportunity here]

For those projects who are willing, we'll post final papers and presentations here on the course website.
